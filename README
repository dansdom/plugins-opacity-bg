Opacity Background plugin

This plugin will allow you to set the opacity of an elements background without it affecting the opacity of the content even in IE6.
For IE6 it uses the DD_BelatedPNG script, so it needs to be included as well if you are supporting that browser.
This plugin is for CSS2.1 users who need to support older browsers. Of course if you don't, then you won't need this plugin.

These are the options:
opacity : number - sets the opacity of the targeted div. range: 0 - 1
pngFix  : boolean - allows integration with DD_BelatedPNG hack for IE6
pngClass: string - can set the class of the pngfix so that it doesn't clash with any other png fix classes in the document
